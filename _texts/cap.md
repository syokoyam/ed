- A - Cap of Lead across
- {:.indent-6}the sky
- Was tight and sur[e?]ly drawn
- We could not find the mighty
- {:.indent-6}Face
- The Figure was withdrawn -
- {:.indent-6}--
- A chill came up as from
- {:.indent-6}a shaft
- Our noon became a well
- A Thunder storm combines the
- {:.indent-6}charms
- Of Winter and of Hell
- {:.indent-6}E
