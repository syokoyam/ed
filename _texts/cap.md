- --   
- *A - Cap of Lead across
- {:.indent-7}the sky
- Was tight and sur[e?]ly drawn
- We could not find the mighty
- {:.indent-7}Face
- The Figure was withdrawn -
- {:.indent-7}--
- A chill came up as from
- {:.indent-7}a shaft
- Our noon became a well
- A Thunder storm combines the
- {:.indent-7}charms
- Of Winter and of Hell
- {:.indent-7}E
